#
# Note about policies and logging:
#	This file contains an explicit policy for every combination of
#	zones defined in this sample.  This is solely for the purpose of
#	providing more specific messages in the logs.  This is not
#	necessary for correct operation of the firewall, but greatly
#	assists in diagnosing problems. The policies below are logically
#	equivalent to:
#
#	loc	net		ACCEPT
#	net	all		DROP		info
#	all	all		REJECT		info
#
#	The Shorewall-perl compiler will generate the individual policies
#	below from the above general policies if you set 
#	EXPAND_POLICIES=Yes in shorewall.conf. 
#

# Policies for traffic originating from the local LAN (loc)
#
# If you want to force clients to access the Internet via a proxy server
# on your firewall, change the loc to net policy to REJECT info.
loc		net		ACCEPT
loc		dmz		ACCEPT
loc		$FW		REJECT		info
loc		all		REJECT		info

#
# Policies for traffic originating from the firewall ($FW)
#
# If you want open access to the Internet from your firewall, change the
# $FW to net policy to ACCEPT and remove the 'info' LOG LEVEL.
# This may be useful if you run a proxy server on the firewall.
$FW		net		REJECT		info
$FW		loc		REJECT		info
$FW		dmz		REJECT		info
$FW		all		REJECT		info

#
# Policies for traffic originating from the Internet zone (net)
#
net		$FW		DROP		info
net		loc		DROP		info
net		dmz		DROP		info
net		all		DROP		info

#
# Policies for traffic originating from the DMZ zone (dmz)
#
dmz		$FW		DROP		info
dmz		net		DROP		info
dmz		loc		DROP		info
dmz		all		DROP		info

# THE FOLLOWING POLICY MUST BE LAST
all		all		REJECT		info
